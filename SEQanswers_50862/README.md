Question originally posted [here](http://seqanswers.com/forums/showthread.php?t=50862). In short, the question is how to extract the number of mismatches (the NM auxiliary tag) and the number of aligned bases (the M, =, or X CIGAR strings) from a BAM file. The `ExtractMismatchFrequency.py` script uses [pysam](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pysam) for accessing the BAM file, so that's a prerequisite.
